## Creating your own suffering writing code

The first thing you will notice is that just setting up your development environment can be a great source of suffering. You go ahead with the suffering because problem solving is innate to you, and so does suffering. You install all the dependencies and your system is up and running. You write your first line of code ('Hello, world!' of course), the screen ouputs the expected value and you can begin with your project.

If you have not done a project before, you have a rough ride ahead of you. Do not get disheartened as your suffering will bring you the most joy after overcoming it and in fact, you will be disappointed when your code runs the first time without issues. Here we go! Time to bring your ideas into fruition with your chosen tech stack. Things are going well and you decide to save your work, close your text editor and take a well deserved break.

You are back at it again, no changes done and run your code to make sure all is in order. BANG!!! You get a double digit list of errors, no changes were made before and after you took a break. You don't know where to start, you got to google to find the answer which lands you to stackoverflow. There is no solution for your generic error and have not been solved for over 7 years on stackoverflow. The suffering continues…

You finally visit the overly technical official documentation site. Congadulations. You have officially reached suffering of the highest order.

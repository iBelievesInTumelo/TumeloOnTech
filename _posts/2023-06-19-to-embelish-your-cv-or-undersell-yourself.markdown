Some new technology has sparked interest in you and you took the time to learn more about it. Moreover you followed along with tutorials and finished all activities and you are quite proficient in it. Another one is you are working on an arbitary task and realised that you need to delve more into a tech obstacle that is standing in the way of finishing up your project. You go down the tutorial rabbit hole and finally complete your project having navigated a major huddle. Congradulations! You have just acquired valuable skills without a formal guide or a structured learning path.

You are not an expert at what you have just learnt but you are pretty confortable applying your newly acquired skills to get the job done. What do you put on your CV or Linkedin profile? You see job adverts seeking a person of your skillset but you don't quite tick all the boxes that are required on the advert. It's time to edit your cv to suit the job posting, keeping in mind that your application will be put through software that will be scanning for key words and you might get an automated response if you don't have the required keywords on your cv.

Do you embellish your cv or undersell yourself? Underselling yourself will not get you through the first stage of the job application and overly embellishing your cv will likely lead to a very tough and brief interview process as you will be seen as an untrustworthy applicant. Try to find the balance, be honest and supply links or proof of training. LinkedIn intergrates really well with a lot of learning platforms and it could be very useful to use sites that can provide proof of training on your LinkedIn profile.

## Conclusion

Do not undersell yourself and if you need to delve more into a new technology, explore sites that offer certificates at the completion of the course or enrol in a formall college or university. New technology comes at a fast pace, universities cannot simply integrate them into their curriculum as quickly as they come. Think about all the 'flavour' of the year new tech that has come and fell out of favour, do not be concerned about ticking all the boxes.
